<h2><b>C#</b></h2>
<span>I have a lot of experience in using C# from game development in Unity. As well, it's my favorite programming language!</span>

<h2><b>Java</b></h2>
<span>I am highly proficient in Java from my schoolwork which heavily uses it. Most of my knowledge of data structures and algorithms was learned through this!</span>

<h2><b>HTML</b></h2>
<span>I've gained a lot of experience in HTML using it primarily for this website project of mine, as well as some past schoolwork in high school</span>

<h2><b>Git/Github</b></h2>
<span>I use github for all of my version control management for my various projects. I do it all through command line as well!</span>

<h2><b>Visual Studio Code</b></h2>
<span>This is always my code editor of choice whenever I have it as an option. I am highly proficient in using it and navigating it!</span>

<h2><b>Virtualbox virtualization</b></h2>
<span>In my spare time I have messed around a fair bit with virtual machines to create safe testing environments for programs!</span>

<h2><b>Windows, MacOS, Linux</b></h2>
<span>I have experience with all three of these operating systems. I primarily use Windows, but over time I have gained experience with MacOS and Linux as well</span>

<h2><b>Microsoft Office 365 Products</b></h2>
<span>This includes Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. I even got certified at one point! (Although that's expired now, my skill with the software sure haven't!)</span>

<h2><b>Punctuality</b></h2>
<span>I am never late and always on time. I make sure people never have to have to wait for me</span>

<h2><b>Teamwork</b></h2>
<span>I always love working on teams and am a very effective member on any project! I'm a strong leader and can make sure everything is done well and efficiently</span>

<h2><b>Communication</b></h2>
<span>Whether it be public speaking, conflict management, or group coordination, I am always an excellent communicator!</span>

<h2><b>Outside of the box thinking</b></h2>
<span>My background in math has forced me to examine problems from every angle, and consider things others may not have ever thought of before.</span>

<h2><b>Challenge-seeking</b></h2>
<span>I'm never content sitting back and not taking on challenges. Every new challenge is an opportunity for growth!</span>

<h2><b>Welcoming of different perspectives and backgrounds</b></h2>
<span>No team can succeed while being unwelcoming! I believe a core component of any strong team is being able to recieve ideas and feedback from anyone!</span>

<h2><b>Adaptability</b></h2>
<span>Nothing is too new, unique, or different for me! I am a fast learner and can pickup anything I put my mind to!</span>
